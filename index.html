			<p>Goa is India's smallest state by area and the fourth smallest by population. Located in West India in the region known as the Konkan, it is bounded by the state of Maharashtra to the north, and by Karnataka to the east and south, while the Arabian Sea forms its western coast. Goa is India's richest state with a GDP per capita two and a half times that of the country as a whole. It was ranked the best placed state by the Eleventh Finance Commission for its infrastructure and ranked on top for the best quality of life in India by the National Commission on Population based on the 12 Indicators.

Panaji is the state's capital, while Vasco da Gama is the largest city. The historic city of Margao still exhibits the cultural influence of the Portuguese, who first landed in the early 16th century as merchants and conquered it soon thereafter. Goa is a former Portuguese province; the Portuguese overseas territory of Portuguese India existed for about 450 years until it was annexed by India in 1961.

Goa is visited by large numbers of international and domestic tourists each year for its beaches, places of worship and world heritage architecture. It also has rich flora and fauna, owing to its location on the Western Ghats range, which is classified as a biodiversity hotspot.</p>

			<p>Goa's history goes back 20,000–30,000 years. The rock art engravings exhibit the earliest traces of human life in India. Upper Paleolithic or Mesolithic rock art engravings have been found on the bank of the river Kushavati at Usgalimal. Petroglyphs, cones, stone-axe, and choppers dating to 10,000 years ago have been found in many places in Goa, such as Kazur, Mauxim, and the Mandovi-Zuari basin. Evidence of Palaeolithic life is seen at Dabolim, Adkon, Shigao, Fatorpa, Arli, Maulinguinim, Diwar, Sanguem, Pilerne, and Aquem-Margaon etc. Difficulty in carbon dating the laterite rock compounds poses a problem for determining the exact time period.

Gold coins issued by the Kadamba king of Goa, Shivachitta Paramadideva. Circa 1147–1187 AD.
Early Goan society underwent radical changes when Indo-Aryan and Dravidian migrants amalgamated with the aboriginal locals, forming the base of early Goan culture.

In the 3rd century BC, Goa was part of the Maurya Empire, ruled by the Buddhist emperor, Ashoka of Magadha. Buddhist monks laid the foundation of Buddhism in Goa. Between the 2nd century BC and the 6th century AD, Goa was ruled by the Bhojas of Goa. Chutus of Karwar also ruled some parts as feudatories of the Satavahanas of Kolhapur (2nd century BC to the 2nd century AD), Western Kshatrapas (around 150 AD), the Abhiras of Western Maharashtra, Bhojas of the Yadav clans of Gujarat, and the Konkan Mauryas as feudatories of the Kalachuris.The rule later passed to the Chalukyas of Badami, who controlled it between 578 to 753, and later the Rashtrakutas of Malkhed from 753 to 963. From 765 to 1015, the Southern Silharas of Konkan ruled Goa as the feudatories of the Chalukyas and the Rashtrakutas. Over the next few centuries, Goa was successively ruled by the Kadambas as the feudatories of the Chalukyas of Kalyani. They patronised Jainism in Goa.

In 1312, Goa came under the governance of the Delhi Sultanate. The kingdom's grip on the region was weak, and by 1370 it was forced to surrender it to Harihara I of the Vijayanagara empire. The Vijayanagara monarchs held on to the territory until 1469, when it was appropriated by the Bahmani sultans of Gulbarga. After that dynasty crumbled, the area fell into the hands of the Adil Shahis of Bijapur, who established as their auxiliary capital the city known under the Portuguese as Velha Goa.</p>

		<a name="beaches"><h1>Beaches</h1>

			<p>Goa's beaches cover about 125 kilometres (78 mi) of its coastline. These beaches are divided into North and South Goa. North Goa is more commercial and touristy with an abundance of mostly low and medium budget tourist accommodations; whereas South Goa is where most higher–end hotels and private beaches are located. A notable exception in South Goa is Palolem Beach which features basic accommodation and is one of the most visited beaches in Goa. The further north or south you go, the more isolated the beaches get. Some of the more popular beaches are Colva, Calangute, Baga and Anjuna. These beaches are lined with shacks that provide fresh sea food and drinks. Some shacks arrange special events to attract more customers.</p>

			<p>Goan cuisine consists of regional foods popular in Goa, located along India's west coast along the Arabian Sea. Chicken, Seafood, coconut milk, rice, and local spices are main ingredients of Goan cuisine. The area is located in a tropical climate, which means that spices and flavors are intense. Use of Kokum is another distinct feature. Goan food is considered incomplete without fish. It is similar to Malvani or Konkani cuisine.

The cuisine of Goa is influenced by its Hindu origins, four hundred years of Portuguese colonialism, and modern techniques. The state is frequently visited by tourists for its beaches and historic sites, so its food has an international aspect.</p>

			<p>The open-air dance party atmosphere of Goa remains alive and well, despite the noise restrictions. Virtually every night, a semi-secret dance party is taking place somewhere in Goa, although it might not necessarily be held at or around in a beach near you. Anjuna, Vagator and Palolem beaches, with their large populations of alternative-oriented backpackers, are the usual epicenters for these events. A party's location is kept a secret until a few hours before it starts, so the best bet is to ask around the local beach bars and shacks around dinner time.

The other way the party scene has beaten the noise restrictions and tightened policing is by going indoors, so most beaches in Goa that are not part of an exclusive resort have their own set of clubs and bars. Anjuna's Shore Bar is something of a Goa nightlife institution and is one of the best places to eat in Anjuna to boot. Vagator's Nine Bar is the setting of a nightly trance and psychedelic dance party. Tito's Bar and Cafe Mambo (titos.in/cafe-mambo.html), a pair of conjoined bars, are one of the major center's for nightlife for the package tourist-oriented Baga Beach.

Bars and dance clubs are not the sole focus for nightlife in Goa. Visitors who want to take in a film Indian-style can see what Bollywood has to offer at the Cine Nacional (no website: Ormuz Road, Panjim) or the INOX Cinema (inoxmovies.com) in Panjim. Goa's casinos are usually found on the water, such as the casino boat Casino Royal (casinoroyalegoa.com). For a more cultural outing, the Kerkar Art Complex (subodhkerkar.com) offers occasional music and dance performances.

The weather in Goa is cooler and drier between November and March, making that the high season for Goan tourism. That fact of climate and the crowds of tourists it brings intertwines with Goa's Christian culture to make the period between Christmas and New Year's the partying period of the year for Goa. For a festival with a more local flavor, however, try Goa's Carnival. For three days in February or March, the parades, feasting and merry-making on the streets of Goa mirror the nightly party scene on the beaches.</p>

			<p>Goa is India’s smallest state by a considerable margin, but its pocket-sized charms exert a powerful allure. You feel the difference immediately on arrival – the familiar subcontinental bustle and jostling give way to a measured languor and broad smiles, and the skies clear to a distant horizon. Just 1,429 square miles, with a population of 1.5 million, this is where the crowded cityscapes of urban India give way to coconut groves; the blare of traffic yields to birdcalls and the insistent whisper of sea on sand. No wonder this is India’s most popular resort destination – not just for travellers from Europe, Israel and Russia, but increasingly for India’s growing middle class, for whom Goa is famously summed up by the Konkani word sussegad, meaning ‘laid-back’ or ‘relaxed’.</p>
