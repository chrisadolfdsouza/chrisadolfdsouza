			<p>Many will tell you that Souza Lobo is not a restaurant or a shack – it is a state of mind. This is the destination of the perfectionist who wants, a great meal in a great restaurant which has pride of place right on a great beach. It is a place that has ruled Calangute Beach for the last 78 years, which is why you have generations of guests coming in weekend after weekend, year after year. Yes, even decade after decade some guests have been coming to Souza Lobo even before the present owner Jude Lobo, was born. 
If Calangute Beach is the best known feature of Calangute. Souza Lobo is the best known feature of Calangute Beach. That says a lot about us.

		<h1>Infantaria Cafe</h1>
			<img src="https://greyindecision.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/infantaria-comfort-goa1.jpg" alt="infantaria" title="infantaria" width="400" height="250"/></a>
			<p>If there is any place in Goa that really encapsulates all that makes Goa the place that you yearn to return year on year, it is Cafe Infantaria. I make that really controversial statement for the following three reasons:
1. Cafe Infantaria is renowned for its breakfast. Breakfast in usually the first meal that one has in Goa if one is travelling by rail, bus or air. Land in Goa, hit Cafe Infantaria and let Goa hit you with all of what it has to offer.
2. Cafe Infantaria is located in North Goa. There are takers of the 5 - stars of the South, there are lovers of the romance of Panjim, there are those who swear by the quaint Goan houses by the river in the interiors. I am sure all are very nice, but to me, because of the crowd, the drink and the food, North Goa is THE place to be and drink and eat.
3. 6 Pints of Beer for Rs 100 (the condition is that the food bill must be Rs 300/-). Ladies and Gentlemen! Welcome to Goa! Welcome to Cafe Infantaria!</p>

		<h1>Baga</h1>
			<img src="http://tourmet.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/baga-beachG1-goa.jpg" alt="baga" title="baga" width="400" height="250"/></a>
			<p>aga Beach is a popular beach and tourist destination in North Goa. Baga is located at the north end of the contiguous beach stretch that starts from Sinquerim, Candolim, leads to Calangute and then to Baga.


Dolphins can be located at around 1–2 km from the shoreline
The beach contains rows of shacks and fishing boats, and at high tide the beach is narrow.

The beach is named after the Baga Creek, which empties into the Arabian Sea at the north end of the beach.

Baga Beach is also famous for parasailing, water sports (banana ride) and dolphin cruises.</p>
