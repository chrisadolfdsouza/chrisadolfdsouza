			<p>VIBE: This place is vibrant and lively with a great ambience. It has a VIP lounge and a pool, and is the only club in Asia open till the last party animal manages to go home or is passed out.
MUSIC: The DJs come from different places across the globe and expertly switch from funky to vocal to tech to progressive to the bare beat. It guarantees a fun time for everyone on the dance floor.
BITES ‘N’ BOOZE: Once you pay the cover-charge which is around Rs. 500-1000, you get free booze throughout the night. However, there is a separate payment counter for highend Indian and foreign liquors. You can pick your choice of cocktail or mocktail from the bar and have a merry time. When it comes to food, only pizzas are available which too are not that bad.
BUCKS TO SHELL: This place is economical and pocketfriendly. After paying your cover charge, you don’t need to worry for the rest of the night. This place ensures a good time even with a minimum budget.

		<h1>Infantaria Cafe</h1>
			<img src="https://greyindecision.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/infantaria-comfort-goa1.jpg" alt="infantaria" title="infantaria" width="400" height="250"/></a>
			<p>If there is any place in Goa that really encapsulates all that makes Goa the place that you yearn to return year on year, it is Cafe Infantaria. I make that really controversial statement for the following three reasons:
1. Cafe Infantaria is renowned for its breakfast. Breakfast in usually the first meal that one has in Goa if one is travelling by rail, bus or air. Land in Goa, hit Cafe Infantaria and let Goa hit you with all of what it has to offer.
2. Cafe Infantaria is located in North Goa. There are takers of the 5 - stars of the South, there are lovers of the romance of Panjim, there are those who swear by the quaint Goan houses by the river in the interiors. I am sure all are very nice, but to me, because of the crowd, the drink and the food, North Goa is THE place to be and drink and eat.
3. 6 Pints of Beer for Rs 100 (the condition is that the food bill must be Rs 300/-). Ladies and Gentlemen! Welcome to Goa! Welcome to Cafe Infantaria!</p>

			<p>Soul Soufle is a restaurant located in Verna, Goa. To get to his restaurant you will need to take the inner road on the left(while going from Panjim to Margao) when you reach the Verna Church. There will be a sign board on the road, which you will need to watch out far. From here its a long way to get to the restaurant. This restaurant is located near the Uddear Springs. Its a nice restaurant to go to if you are looking for a nice quiet romantic lunch or afternoon. The food and service at the place is also nice.</p>
