			<p>VIBE: This place is vibrant and lively with a great ambience. It has a VIP lounge and a pool, and is the only club in Asia open till the last party animal manages to go home or is passed out.
MUSIC: The DJs come from different places across the globe and expertly switch from funky to vocal to tech to progressive to the bare beat. It guarantees a fun time for everyone on the dance floor.
BITES ‘N’ BOOZE: Once you pay the cover-charge which is around Rs. 500-1000, you get free booze throughout the night. However, there is a separate payment counter for highend Indian and foreign liquors. You can pick your choice of cocktail or mocktail from the bar and have a merry time. When it comes to food, only pizzas are available which too are not that bad.
BUCKS TO SHELL: This place is economical and pocketfriendly. After paying your cover charge, you don’t need to worry for the rest of the night. This place ensures a good time even with a minimum budget.
FAB OR DRAB: If you are visiting Goa, Club Cubana is one place you don’t want to miss. It is considered to be one of the best in the Goan party scene.
BEST NIGHT: Ladies Night on Wednesdays and Models Night on Saturdays. Arpora Hill, Anjuna Road, Near Marinha Dourada Hotel, Goa.</p>

			<p>Curlie’s is a popular beach shack, located on the Anjuna Beach strip. This was one of the first ever beach shacks to set up in Goa. What started as a small shack has today become a landmark on Anjuna beach, expanding over the years, and recently, extending to a second floor, with further plans for growth in the near future. The family business additionally includes various beach hut accommodations and cottages, including a recent acquisition of The Hobbit.

Facilities include a roof top lounge bar, restaurant, well stocked bar serving some of the best liquor and special cocktails, and is host to special party nights with international DJs. Curlie's is open all day and into the night, and is a well known tourist spot for watching the sunset, grabbing a bite to eat, enjoying drinks with friends and partying at night.</p>
